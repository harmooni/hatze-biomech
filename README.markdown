# A Matlab implementation of Hatze's 1980 anthropometric body segment parameter model

H. Hatze published an anthropomorphic model of the human body in 1979/1980 that was composed of 17 body segments with varying cross-section and density.
It accurately models the masses, centroids, and moments of inertia for these body segments using a total of 242 anthropometric measurements of an individual.
It is the most detailed such model developed, but is little used due to its large number of measurements required and the mathematical complexity involved in using those measurements.

The code herein replicates (or will) Hatze's model in Matlab, providing a public implementation of his model for the first time.
We hope that this will increase the viability of using his model.
